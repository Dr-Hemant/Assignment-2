## Overview

This repository includes solutions for two tasks from **Module 3: Control Structures in Python**. The tasks are:

- Task 1: Check whether a number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.
- Task 2: Use a `for` loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 50.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### Description

This Python program:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an `if-else` control structure.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

### Description

This Python program:
1. Uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the total sum of these numbers.
3. Displays the final result.
